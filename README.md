2048 Game
=========

Just another 2048 game. This was developed as a pet project for the following purposes:
- Attempt to code up a game
- Attempt to write a solver to solve 2048 as well or better than I can (which should be too hard!)

## Features
- Console based JS play
- HTML5 canvas front end play
- Solvers to automatically play 2048
